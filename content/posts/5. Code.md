title = "5. Code"
description = "By using the sdk for ICM20948 and LCD_st7735, we are now able to successfully read the acceleration and gravity data from IMU(ICM20948) and get it to display on the LCD screen (LCD_st7735) which is used by PIO. The code is in this [repo](https://github.com/ese5190-walkman/ese-5190_final_project/tree/main/code/in-progress)."

Also, following professor's advice, we tried to find a few fixed reference points based on the camera module but we observed that the array read by camera was strange and it was hard to extract the data from it and find a few points as coordinate points within limitted amount of time. So we gave up that idea.
